Hallo!
dotfiles here, j's dotfiles.
for me, and for whoever is not afraid to dare.
if ur lucky maybe things won't break, but u have my emotional support in case of bad scenarios.

nownow, I also made some scripts, well, because I don't think i'll remember how to do things.
I don' t think I have to explain them, if I was able to made them I'm pretty sure you would be able to make them too, but lazyness is a bad thing indeed.

maybe someday i will learn to make a readme file, or at least try.

I don' t like people to shout, so this file's name is in lowercase...
